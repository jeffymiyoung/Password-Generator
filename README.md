# Random Password Generator
Have you ever wanted to generate a random password with certain criteria? As a developer, I wanted to make an application that provided just that! Through a series of prompts, one can generate a strong password that can meet any website's specifications. 

## Technologies:
* HTML 
* CSS 
* JavaScript

## How To:
Through a series of prompts, input the desired criteria for the user's random password to be generated. Copy the password from the text box, and past it into whichever application you need it for! Remember to store your password in a secure location, and don't share it with anyone!
